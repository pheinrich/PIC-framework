PIC Framework
Copyright Â© 2006,2008  Peter Heinrich

This is a catch-all library of various utility routines for the Microchip PIC
18Fxxxx-series of microcontrollers (16-bit), coded in assembler.  It was init-
ially part of a larger project, but it soon became clear that many useful
routines could be refactored into an independent library.  Some examples:

  * a millisecond-resolution wall-clock, with alarm
  * basic console out via serial TX
  * EEPROM access routines
  * a generic wrapper for M25P-type Flash memories
  * a wrapper for the MAX6957 LED driver and port extender
  * a basic Galois LFSR random number generator
  * basic SPI communication routines
  * USART support routines, including parity calculation/verification
  * virtual function table support

In the interests of expediency, there are a few minor application-specific
assumptions (e.g. that SPI uses RA3 as chip select, or that RC1 ought to
generate a 1 Hz pulse train tied to the wall-clock, or that the Fosc is
24 MHz); these may be changed at will, of course.
