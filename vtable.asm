;;  void VTable.dispatch( frame[0..1] funcKey, TBLPTR vtable )
;;
;;  Iterates over a list of key-value entries stored in program memory,
;;  searching for a function pointer that matches the key specified.  Each
;;  entry in the key-value list starts with a 16-bit identifier, followed by
;;  the lower 16 bits of a program memory address in little-endian format (the
;;  upper 5 bits are always treated as 0).
;;
;;  This method searches linearly through the list until a matching id or -1
;;  is found.  The ids don't have to be in any particular numerical order, al-
;;  though sorting the most-used entries to the beginning of the list will
;;  improve performance.  If a match isn't found, the vector associated with
;;  the -1 identifier will be used to simulate a "missing_method" call, else
;;  program execution will be transferred to the matching address.
;;
;;  Here's an example of how a vtable might be declared.  Each numerical value
;;  indicates a function id, while the symbols following refer to program
;;  memory locations:
;;
;;     .mySection code
;;     myVTbl:
;;       data     1,  readCoils
;;       data     2,  readDiscretes
;;       data     4,  readInputs
;;       data     15, writeCoils
;;       data     16, writeRegisters
;;       data     20, readFileRecord
;;       data     -1, unsupported      ; required terminator/default handler
